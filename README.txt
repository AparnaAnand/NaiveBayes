nblearn3.py is a program that trains on the training data to create the Naive Bayes model. It obtains the directory that contains all the training data from the command line and reads all the files in the directory under the 4 categories "Positive", "Negative", "Deceptive" and "Truthful". It outputs the model's parameters into an output file.
nbclassify3.py is a program that reads the output file created by nblearn3.py, and uses the model to classify the new unseen test data present in unknown categories. The output is a labelling of each new .txt file into either "Positive" or "Negative" and either "Truthful" or "Deceptive".
